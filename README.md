# HelloFresh Front End Challenge
## Grey Joyner
## Graduate Software Engineer Position

### Overview
Front-end React web app for viewing and adding menus and recipes, created with create-react-app

### Deployment
https://hellofreshfrontend.netlify.app/

### Installation instructions
`yarn add axois`
`yarn add react-router-dom`

### Build instructions
`yarn start`

### Assignment notes
This app does not fulfil all the requirements of the challenge, as it had already taken me well over the 4 hour time limit to complete. With more time, I would like to add styling to the website, add functionality for editing and deleting recipes and menus, add functionality for assigning recipes to menus, add unit and E2E tests and add in solution diagrams.
